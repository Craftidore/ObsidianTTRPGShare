# TTRPG Specific Resources Readme

Hey, whats the idea! What goes here?

I'm so glad you asked. These folders are for very specific content that may not necessarily fit other existing folders. For example, the `Dataview Scripts` folder as of writing has a section for `Any-TTRPG` and `DND`, but that is more due to the fact its layouts are oriented towards DND or generic that we have those folders. The subject matter is still neat Dataview Scripts at its core. 

For this folder and its subfolders, it is all about the actual content of the TTRPG. 

- Do you have some custom dice icons you made for Genesys? It goes here. 

- Do you have an analysis of lore you wrote for traveller that you want to share? It goes here. 

- A Sectors without Numbers map? It goes here.

- Homebrew rule suggestions for Warhammer? It goes here.

And so on.

The focus is the TTRPG itself. The rest of the folders in the repository focus on the Obsidian side of things, and then sort by the TTRPG it best pertains to.
