You seek to join the Free Captains of the Shackles and have learned everything you need to know about sailing and bossing people around. Now you just need a crew and a ship.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [[Intimidation]] skill and the [[Sailing Lore]] skill.

You gain the [[Group Coercion]] skill feat.
