[[### Guard]]
`=this.traits`


You served in the guard, out of either patriotism or the need for coin. Either way, you know how to get a difficult suspect to talk.

However you left the guard, you might think of adventuring as a way to use your skills on a wider stage.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [[Intimidation]] skill and the [[Legal Lore]] or [[Warfare Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Quick Coercion]] skill feat.
