[[### Seer Of The Dead]]
`=this.traits`


You have long been gifted with the ability to see and speak with the departed. This could have manifested at your birth or when a chance encounter linked you inextricably to the spirits of the dead. Their constant presence might feel like a curse, or it might provide you with welcome companionship.

You gain one ability boost. It must be to Constitution or Wisdom.

You're trained in [[Religion]] and [[Undead Lore]]. You gain the effects of the [[spirit sense]] spell at all times.
