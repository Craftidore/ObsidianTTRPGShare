[[### Child Of Westcrown]]
`=this.traits`


Whether you come from Westcrown or elsewhere, you hold the values of pre-Thrune Cheliax dear. You disdain the infernal government, but you are proud of your country and do not consider yourself a rebel.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [[Diplomacy]] skill and the [[Westcrown Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Group Impression]] skill feat.
