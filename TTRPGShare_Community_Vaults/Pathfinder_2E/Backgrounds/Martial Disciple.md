You dedicated yourself to intense training and rigorous study to become a great warrior. The school you attended might have been a traditionalist monastery, an elite military academy, or the local branch of a prestigious mercenary organization.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in your choice of the [[Acrobatics]] or [[Athletics]] skill. You gain a skill feat: [[Cat Fall]] if you chose [[Acrobatics]] or [[Quick Jump]] if you chose [[Athletics]]. You're also trained in the [[Warfare Lore]] skill.
