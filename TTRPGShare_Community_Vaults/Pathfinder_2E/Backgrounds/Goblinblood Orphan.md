[[### Goblinblood Orphan]]
`=this.traits`


Your family, whether goblin, hobgoblin, or human, died in the Goblinblood Wars. Though you were marked by these losses, you managed to survive through your own resilience and resourcefulness.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [[Survival]] skill and the [[Goblin Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Assurance]] skill feat with [[Survival]].
