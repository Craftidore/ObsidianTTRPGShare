[[### Detective]]
`=this.traits`


You solved crimes as a police inspector or took jobs for wealthy clients as a private investigator. You might have become an adventurer as part of your next big mystery, but likely it was due to the consequences or aftermath of a prior case.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [[Society]] skill and the [[Underworld Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Streetwise]] skill feat.
