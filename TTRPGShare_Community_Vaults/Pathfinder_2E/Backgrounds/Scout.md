[[### Scout]]
`=this.traits`


You called the wilderness home as you found trails and guided travelers. Your wanderlust could have called you to the adventuring life, or perhaps you served as a scout for soldiers and found you liked battle.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [[Survival]] skill and a [[Lore]] skill related to one terrain you scouted in (such as [[Forest Lore]] or [[Cavern Lore]]). You gain the [[Forager]] skill feat.
