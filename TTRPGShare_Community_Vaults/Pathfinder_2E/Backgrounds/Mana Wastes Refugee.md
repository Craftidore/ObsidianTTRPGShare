[[### Mana Wastes Refugee]]
`=this.traits`


Exposure to the corrupting influence of the Mana Wastes' strange energies has warped your inner essence, resulting in unpredictable interactions with magic items and more than a little know-how about surviving under bizarre and adverse natural conditions.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [[Arcana]] skill and the [[Wilderness Lore]] skill.

You gain the [[Trick Magic Item]] skill feat.
