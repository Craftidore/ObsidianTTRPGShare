[[### Prisoner]]
`=this.traits`


You might have been imprisoned for crimes (whether you were guilty or not), or enslaved for some part of your upbringing.

In your adventuring life, you take full advantage of your newfound freedom.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [[Stealth]] skill and the [[Underworld Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Experienced Smuggler]] skill feat.
