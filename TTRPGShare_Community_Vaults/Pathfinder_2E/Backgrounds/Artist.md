[[### Artist]]
`=this.traits`


Your art is your greatest passion, whatever form it takes.

Adventuring might help you find inspiration, or simply be a way to survive until you become a world-famous artist.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [[Crafting]] skill and the [[Art Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Specialty Crafting]] skill feat.
