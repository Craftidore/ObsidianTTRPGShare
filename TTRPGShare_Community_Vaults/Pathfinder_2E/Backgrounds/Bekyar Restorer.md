[[### Bekyar Restorer]]
`=this.traits`


Though many Bekyars worship demons, you seek to pave a different path for yourself and your kindred, while also attempting to change other Mwangi's treatment of your culture.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [[Diplomacy]] skill and the [[Abyss Lore]] skill.

You gain the [[Group Impression]] skill feat.
