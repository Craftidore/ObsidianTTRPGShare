[[### Returned]]
`=this.traits`


You died and miraculously returned with knowledge of the realms beyond death and a stronger link to life. Some dead and undead souls might feel a strange, instinctual kinship with you.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You gain the [[Diehard]] feat and the [[Additional Lore]] feat for [[Boneyard Lore]].
