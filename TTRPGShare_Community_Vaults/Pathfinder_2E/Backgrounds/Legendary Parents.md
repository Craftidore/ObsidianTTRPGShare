[[### Legendary Parents]]
`=this.traits`


One or more of your parents (either biological or adoptive) were heroes of the Age of Ashes Adventure Path. Others tend to treat you with a bit more respect, or perhaps fear your connections to people of great power.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be in Dexterity or Charisma, and the other is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [[Intimidation]] skill and the [[Genealogy Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Group Coercion]] skill feat.
