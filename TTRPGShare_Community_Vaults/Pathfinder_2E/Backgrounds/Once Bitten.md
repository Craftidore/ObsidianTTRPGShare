[[### Once Bitten]]
`=this.traits`


After an altercation with an undead creature, you feared you might be infected. Either through medical intervention, luck, or misunderstanding how undeath spreads, your fears abated. However, your brush with living death taught you the value of life. You do whatever you can to avoid the end you thought you'd been fated.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [[Medicine]] skill and the [[Undead Lore]] skill. You gain the [[Battle Medicine]] skill feat.
