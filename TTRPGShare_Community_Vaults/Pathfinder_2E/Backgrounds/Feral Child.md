[[### Feral Child]]
`=this.traits`


You spent your youth in the wilderness, living close to or perhaps raised by animals. You have a close, mystical connection with these animals and gained certain abilities from them, though this limited your well-roundedness in mental pursuits.

Choose one ability boost. It must be Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

You are trained in [[Nature]] and [[Survival]]. You gain [[low-light vision]] (or [[darkvision]] if you already had [[low-light vision]]), imprecise [[scent]] with a range of 30 feet, and the [[Forager]] skill feat.
