# PF2E SRD Suggested Actions

I have checked this vault out and here are some things I would suggest doing in no order of importance:

- Aliasing the files. Obsidian Linter can help with this. This allows you to rename similar problem files like Darkness (which I already renamed Darkness and Darkness_Spell).
- Going through the PF2E SRD in order and checking to see if the files appear in order. If something is missing, add it. It may be worth tagging the file as checked, so when the conversion is done, any files without checked could be investigated as to why they exist.
- I did an initial conversion to markdown links. There may be some stragglers.
- Clean up the map of content pages to make the links more readable. Right now they are all bunched together.

Thanks for taking this on. :) - @Sigrunixia/@Littlemaelstrom
