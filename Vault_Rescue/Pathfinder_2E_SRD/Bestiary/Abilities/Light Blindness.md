# Light Blindness
*Source* Bestiary pg. 343

When first exposed to bright light, the monster is [Blinded](../../Conditions/Blinded.md) until the end of its next turn. After this exposure, light doesn’t blind the monster again until after it spends 1 hour in [1 TTRPG/PF2e Wiki/Traits/Darkness](1%20TTRPG/PF2e%20Wiki/Traits/Darkness). However, as long as the monster is in an area of bright light, it’s [Dazzled](../../Conditions/Dazzled.md).
