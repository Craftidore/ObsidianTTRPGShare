Your eidolon is a demon, born of mortal sin congealed amid the chaos and evil of the Abyss, using its link to you to spread chaos at your side. Choose an associated sin for your demon. Demon eidolons have appearances as varied as the infinite Abyss.

While demons are inherently untrustworthy, your demon eidolon has reached an accord with you and generally keeps it, though that doesn't mean your eidolon isn't actively working to bring your life deeper into its associated sin. Though a true demon, your demon eidolon's link to you as a mortal prevents them from casting the abyssal pact ritual, even if they somehow learn it.

### Demonic Strikes
Your eidolon's attacks are corrupted by the Abyss and imbued with pure evil and shifting chaos. All your eidolon's [Unarmed](../../../Traits/Unarmed.md) Strikes deal an extra 1 evil damage; as usual, this extra damage harms only good creatures or those with a weakness to evil damage. Additionally, choose one of your eidolon's unarmed attacks that deals physical damage; it gains the [versatile](versatile) trait for a different type of physical damage you choose.

### Visions of Sin (7th) ►►

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

Your eidolon summons images of its sin into the mind of a target creature within 30 feet, tormenting and confusing the target. The target must attempt a Will save against your spell DC with the following effects. The effects last until the end of your next turn, but your eidolon can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to extend the effects until the end of your next turn (like Sustaining a Spell), to a maximum duration of 1 minute. If the target is evil, it takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its save. Regardless of whether it succeeds, the target becomes temporarily immune for 1 day.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target can't use reactions.
**Failure** The target is [Slowed](../../../Conditions/Slowed.md) 1 and can't use reactions.
**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target is also [Confused](../../../Conditions/Confused.md) for 1 round. The confusion can't be extended, but the other effects can.

### Blasphemous Decree (17th)
Your demon utters indescribable words writhing with its associated sin. It can cast an evil [Divine Decree](../../../Magic/Spells/Level%207/Divine%20Decree.md) once per day as a 9th-level spell. You are unaffected by this decree, even if you aren't evil. At 19th level, this becomes a 10th-level divine decree instead.
