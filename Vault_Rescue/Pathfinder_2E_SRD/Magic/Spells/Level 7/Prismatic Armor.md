You wrap the target in armor made of multicolored light. It functions as chromatic armor that is all colors (granting resistance 5 to acid, electricity, fire, force, mental, poison, and sonic). An attacker that critically fails on its saving throw against the spell is [Blinded](../../../Conditions/Blinded.md) rather than [Dazzled](../../../Conditions/Dazzled.md).

<hr>

**Heightened (9th)** The resistances increase to 10 each.
