**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target takes `dice: 5d6|avg` mental damage, is [Frightened](../../../Conditions/Frightened.md) 1, and can't benefit from circumstance or status bonuses for 1 round.
**Failure** The target takes `dice: 10d6|avg` mental damage, is [Frightened](../../../Conditions/Frightened.md) 3, and can't benefit from circumstance or status bonuses for 1 week.
**Critical Failure** The target takes `dice: 20d6|avg` mental damage and is [Frightened](../../../Conditions/Frightened.md) 4. It can't benefit from circumstance or status bonuses until the curse is ["broken]("broken). While the curse remains, the target's allies are also unable to benefit from circumstance or status bonuses while within 15 feet of it.
