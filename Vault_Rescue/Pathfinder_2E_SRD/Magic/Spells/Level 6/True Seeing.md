You see things within 60 feet as they actually are. The GM rolls a secret [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) check against any illusion or transmutation in the area, but only for the purpose of determining whether you see through it (for instance, if the check succeeds against a polymorph spell, you can see the creature's true form, but you don't end the polymorph spell).
