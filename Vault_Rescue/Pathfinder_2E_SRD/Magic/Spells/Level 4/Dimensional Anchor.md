You interfere with the target's ability to teleport and travel between dimensions. Dimensional anchor attempts to [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) any [Teleportation](../../../Traits/Teleportation.md) effect, or any effect that would move the target to a different plane. The duration is determined by the target's Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The effect's duration is 1 minute.
**Failure** The effect's duration is 10 minutes.
**Critical Failure** The effect's duration is 1 hour.
