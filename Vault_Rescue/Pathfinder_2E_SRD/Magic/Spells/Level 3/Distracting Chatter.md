---
You bombard a target with distracting auditory illusions, surrounding them with a tumultuous cacophony of overlapping speech, whispers, screams, and muttering. The target is [Flat-footed](../../../Conditions/Flat-footed.md), takes a –2 status penalty to purely auditory Perception checks, and must succeed at a DC 5 flat check to use auditory abilities or verbal spell components. Similarly, a creature who attempts to affect the target with an auditory effect must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the attempt fails. The duration depends on the target's Will save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The duration is 1 round.
**Failure** The duration is 3 rounds.
**Critical Failure** The duration is 1 minute.
