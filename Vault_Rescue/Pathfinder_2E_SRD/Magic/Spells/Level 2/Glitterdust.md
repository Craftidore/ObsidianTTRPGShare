---
Creatures in the area are outlined by glittering dust. Each creature must attempt a Reflex save. If a creature has its invisibility negated by this spell, it is [Concealed](../../../Conditions/Concealed.md) instead of [Invisible](../../../Conditions/Invisible.md). This applies both if the creature was already [Invisible](../../../Conditions/Invisible.md) and if it benefits from new invisibility effects before the end of the invisibility negation effect from this spell.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
**Success** The target's invisibility is negated for 2 rounds.
**Failure** The target is [Dazzled](../../../Conditions/Dazzled.md) for 1 minute and its invisibility is negated for 1 minute.
**Critical Failure** The target is [Blinded](../../../Conditions/Blinded.md) for 1 round and [Dazzled](../../../Conditions/Dazzled.md) for 10 minutes. Its invisibility is negated for 10 minutes.
