**Range** 120 feet; **Area** 20-foot burst
**Saving Throw** basic Fortitude

---
You accelerate the processes of decay in the area. Each living creature in the area takes `dice: 2d10|avg` negative damage (basic Fortitude save). A creature afflicted by a [Disease](../../../Traits/Disease.md) takes a –2 circumstance penalty to this save.

You can also direct the blight to rot all Small and Tiny non-creature plants in the area, eliminating non-magical undergrowth and any resulting difficult terrain, cover, and concealment. Sudden blight attempts to [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) any magical effect on the plants before withering them.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d10.
