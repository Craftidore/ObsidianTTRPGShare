Your ode temporarily staves off death. The target's dying condition remains 1 below the value at which it dies. This doesn't help prevent death from effects that kill the target without increasing its dying condition, such as [Disintegrate](../../Spells/Level%206/Disintegrate.md) and [Death](../../../Traits/Death.md) effects.
