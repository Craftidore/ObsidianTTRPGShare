# Templates Readme


## Adding a Template
When adding your template, please maintain the following conformity.

**Template FileName**: YourChosenName_TemplateType.md

**Screenshot Filename**: Images/YourChosenName_TemplateType.image

Inside your file, please include in a markdown `% comment %` and/or back-ticked `comment` comment what dependencies are needed to make the template run. For example:

```
**Plugin Dependencies**: 

[Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)

[Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)

[Admonitions](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-admonition)

**Thanks To**: [Your Name Here](Your Link Here)
```

Similarly, include what the goals are of the template are so the user knows what to expect when they load the template into Obsidian. If there are any special activation conditions, this is also the place to put them.

If you have any features, add that as well. The more, the merrier!


## Using a Template

If a Plugin Dependency is listed, it is expected that you will be proficient with this plugin and will know how to read and use the template. 

If you do not understand the template nor how to use it, we direct you to the following:

1. Read up on the individual plugin's documentation while altering the templates

2. Asking for help on the Obsidian Forums

3. Asking for help on the Obsidian Discord channels appropriately

**Do not ask the contributor's directly for assistance**. 

They are **not support personnel**. 

Plus, that is just **rude**.
