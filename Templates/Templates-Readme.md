# Templates Readme


When adding your template, please maintain the following conformity.

**Template FileName**: YourChosenName_TemplateType.md

**Screenshot Filename**: Images/YourChosenName_TemplateType.image

Inside your file, please include in a markdown `% comment %` and/or backticked `comment` comment what dependencies are needed to make the template run. For example:

```
**Plugin Dependencies**: 
[Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)
[Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)
[Admonitions](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-admonition)
**Thanks To**: [Your Name Here](Your Link Here)
```

Similarly, include what the goals are of the template are so the user knows what to expect when they load the template into Obsidian. If there are any special activation conditions, this is also the place to put them.

If you have any features, add that as well. The more, the merrier!
