# Beware of Dragons
This is a section of tools, scripts, and other features that are near completion, have been tested, but need some more hands on it to confirm it works on edge-cases.

## How to this use folder as a contributor
If you are uploading your content for testing, grab a copy of the [**Testing Template**](testing-template.md), fill it out, and include it in your pull request. 

Your pull request will need to contain the submission in the following format:

```md
Folder Structure: 
Root/Testers Wanted/Your Chosen Name - Your Folder Name/

Included Files: 
1. Your files
2. Any specific licenses for your created content if it is not the MIT License
3. "your chosen name - your tool name - testing template.md"
```

## How to use this folder as a tester
First, back up your vaults. Do not use this on your main vault without backing up up in multiple places first. 

**We are not responsible for any degradation of data because you skipped this step. You have been warned.** 

Next, read the testing template in the tool you plan to use carefully. It will include all the details about how to install it, who to contact if you need help or have suggestions, and all the required tools you need.

Finally, after you have tested it for some hours, or days, please provide feedback to the submitter. Even a simple "This works great!" is data that they need to determine if this tool can be moved to one of the main folders.
