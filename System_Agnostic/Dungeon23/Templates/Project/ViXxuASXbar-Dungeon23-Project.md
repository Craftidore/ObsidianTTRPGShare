**Summary**:: The Dungeon23 project is a DM challenge to draw/write one dungeon room per day, every day, for 2023. Rooms are grouped together by week, so eventually there are 52 different modular sets of 7-room dungeons, each connected into a **megadungeon**. The megadungeon can be a *dungeon*, but it could also be an overland map, a world, a massive space ship - whatever. The goal is to *Create Every Day*.
