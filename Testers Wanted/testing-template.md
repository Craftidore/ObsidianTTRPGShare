# your chosen name - your tool name - Testing Template
If you load this into Obsidian, you may need to remove the backticks.

Information that is necessary to achieve the look and feel of your submission needs to go in this area

Basic Formatting:
- Links should be bolded for viewability
- Attribution should be included in title of file as well as in the "Thanks" link.
- "`Thanks To`" if one contributor, "`Big Thanks To`" if more than one. 
  See Leah's Dataview Character Cards for Example. 
- If you include content from other creators, please ensure you follow their license requirements. 
  For example, Kepano requires keeping the license in their CSS snippets.
  In some cases, Kepano requires a link to their "Buy Me a Coffee" page on the repository readme.md.
- Headers should increment only one header at a time. H1 -> H2 is good. H1 -> H4 is not good. 

Code Block Formatting:
- Include both a Sample Code Block and a Code Block That will Render True when loaded into Obsidian. 
- You do not need to provide images or YAML files for the example to work as in screenshots. 
  It only needs to render so the user can plug in their own data.

__Plugins Required__: [**Plugin Name**](pluginlink)

## Contact Information
````
%
This is where you would put how users can contact you to report issues, give a kudos, and to receive direction on where they should seek support. 

You may need to give support directly, or triage and determine if the issue is something else that requires them to seek help on another repository, Obsidian Discord, or Obsidian Forums.
