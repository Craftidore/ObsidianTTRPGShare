# Contingency
#pf/trait 
*Source* Secrets of Magic pg. 252 1.1

Spells with this trait grant you an action during the spell's effects, typically a reaction with a special trigger. They typically have a long duration, such as 24 hours. You can have only one spell with the contingency trait, or one contingency spell, active at a time. If you cast another spell with the contingency trait or contingency, the newer casting supersedes the older.
