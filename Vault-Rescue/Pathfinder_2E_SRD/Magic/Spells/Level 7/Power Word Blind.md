---
You utter an arcane word of power that can make the target [Blinded](../../../Conditions/Blinded.md) upon hearing it. Once targeted, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. The effect of the spell depends on the target's level.

**11th or Lower** The target is [Blinded](../../../Conditions/Blinded.md) permanently.
**12th–13th** The target is [Blinded](../../../Conditions/Blinded.md) for `dice: 1d4|avg` minutes.
**14th or Higher** The target is [Dazzled](../../../Conditions/Dazzled.md) for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+1)** The levels at which each outcome applies increase by 2.
