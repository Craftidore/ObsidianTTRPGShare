---
You cause the creature's vision to become particularly sensitive. The creature must attempt a Fortitude save. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is [Dazzled](../../../Conditions/Dazzled.md) for 1 round.
**Failure** The creature is [Dazzled](../../../Conditions/Dazzled.md) for 1 minute.
**Critical Failure** The creature gains light blindness for 1 minute. If the creature is already exposed to bright light, it immediately becomes [Blinded](../../../Conditions/Blinded.md), as it isn't acclimated to its newly acquired light blindness.
