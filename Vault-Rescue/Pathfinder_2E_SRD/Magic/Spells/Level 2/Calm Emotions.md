---
You forcibly calm creatures in the area, soothing them into a nonviolent state; each creature must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** Calming urges impose a –1 status penalty to the creature's attack rolls.
**Failure** Any emotion effects that would affect the creature are suppressed and the creature can't use [Hostile](../../../Conditions/Hostile.md) actions. If the target is subject to hostility from any other creature, it ceases to be affected by calm emotions.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but hostility doesn't end the effect.
