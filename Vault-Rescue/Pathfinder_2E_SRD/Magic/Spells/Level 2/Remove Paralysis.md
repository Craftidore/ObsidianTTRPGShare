A surge of energy frees a [Paralyzed](../../../Conditions/Paralyzed.md) creature. You can attempt to [counteract](../../../Rules/Counteracting.md) a single effect imposing the [Paralyzed](../../../Conditions/Paralyzed.md) condition on the target. This does not cure someone who is [Paralyzed](../../../Conditions/Paralyzed.md) from some natural state or effect, such as paralysis caused by non-magical wounds or toxins.

**Heightened (6th)** The spell's range increases to 30 feet, and you can target up to 10 creatures.
