**Traditions** primal
**Spell List** elemental
**Cast** single action | somatic
**Range** 5 feet; **Targets** a handful of dirt or mud
**Duration** 10 minutes

---
You purify some dirt or mud into a pliable, claylike plaster that can aid in clotting and healing. This restorative substance can be used in lieu of healer's tools for Medicine checks to [Administer First Aid](../../../Actions/Administer%20First%20Aid.md) or [Treat Wounds](../../../Actions/Treat%20Wounds.md). If the plaster isn't used within the spell's duration, or if you Cast the Spell again before using the plaster, it reverts to being normal non-magical earth.

---
**Heightened (3rd)** The plaster grants anyone using it to Administer First Aid or Treat Wounds a +1 item bonus to the Medicine check.
