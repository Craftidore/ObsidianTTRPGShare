The target is energized by its good fortune as it spreads to others—as long as they keep winning. It gains the [Quickened](../../../Conditions/Quickened.md) condition for 1 round. If the target or one of their allies within 20 feet gets a critical success on an attack roll against a significant foe, whoever got the critical success becomes [Quickened](../../../Conditions/Quickened.md) if they weren't already, and the duration of the winning streak is extended by another round. 

Creatures [Quickened](../../../Conditions/Quickened.md) by the spell can use the extra action to [Strike](../../../Actions/Strike.md), [Step](../../../Actions/Step.md), or [Stride](../../../Actions/Stride.md). If a full round passes without the target or one their allies critically succeeding on an attack roll against a significant foe, the winning streak breaks and the spell ends.
