You pray for swift and painful death to your enemies and find your and your allies' weapons blessed to deliver just that. The target weapons are coated with [Giant Scorpion Venom](../../../Items/Alchemical%20Items/Alchemical%20Poisons/Giant%20Scorpion%20Venom.md) with a DC equal to your spell DC. The effects remain on a weapon for 1 minute or until the weapon deals damage, whichever comes first.
