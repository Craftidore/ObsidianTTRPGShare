You attune a creature to the Positive Energy Plane, connecting its life force without fully transporting it. The creature's appearance becomes more brightly colored. If the creature is living, it heals `dice: 1d8|avg` Hit Points immediately and at the end of each of your turns. Effects that increase healing only increase the initial healing.

If the creature is [Undead](../../../Traits/Undead.md) or has [Negative](../../../Traits/Negative.md) healing, it instead takes `dice: 1d8|avg` positive damage, depending on the result of its Will save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature is damaged once and the spell ends.
**Failure** The creature is damaged immediately and at the end of each of your turns (so twice in the round you Cast the Spell).
**Critical Failure** As failure, and the damage is doubled.

<hr>

**Heightened (+3)** The damage and healing each increase by `dice: 1d8|avg`.
