You spend 10 minutes affixing a [talisman](talisman) to an item, placing the item on a stable surface and using the repair kit with both hands. You can also use this activity to remove a talisman.

Attaching more than one talisman to an item deactivates all the talismans. They must be removed and re-affixed before they can be used again.
