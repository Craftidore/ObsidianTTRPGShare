This is a repository for the downloading and sharing TTRPG elements that may be useful for [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md) TTRPG Users. We also utilize this repository as a headquarters to 

## Now Available
Our [**Master Resources Wiki**](https://github.com/ObsidianTTRPGProject/ObsidianTTRPGShare/wiki) is now available to add recommended content to. Anyone with a Github account may add to the Wiki.

## Goals

The ObsidianTTRPGShare currently maintains three goals:

1. Encouraging the collection and categorization of data shared on [**Obsidian Discord**](https://discord.gg/obsidianmd) that would otherwise become lost and forgotten over time.
2. Act as an incubator for refining those elements so they may be added to the [**Obsidian TTRPG Hub**](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/04+-+Guides%2C+Workflows%2C+%26+Courses/for+TTRPG).
3. Serve as a space for identifying and growing in-need TTRPG communities who lack adequate starter resources within the Obsidian Community through our [**SRD-to-Vault**](https://github.com/ObsidianTTRPGProject/ObsidianTTRPGShare/issues/4) Conversion Project.
4. Maintain a [**Master Resources Wiki**](https://github.com/ObsidianTTRPGProject/ObsidianTTRPGShare/wiki) of quality resources for TTRPG players and Game Masters that coordinate well with Obsidian.
