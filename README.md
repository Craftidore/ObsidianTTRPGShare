# ObsidianTTRPGShare
This is a repository for downloading and sharing TTRPG elements that may be useful for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) TTRPG Users. 


## Goals
The ObsidianTTRPGShare currently maintains three goals

1. Encouraging the collection and categorization of data shared on Obsidian Discord that would otherwise become lost and forgotten over time. 
2. Act as an incubator for refining those elements so they may be added to the [Obsidian TTRPG Hub](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/04+-+Guides%2C+Workflows%2C+%26+Courses/for+TTRPG). 
3. Serve as a space for identifying and growing in-need TTRPG communities who lack adequate starter resources within the Obsidian Community through our [SRD-to-Vault](https://github.com/ObsidianTTRPGProject/ObsidianTTRPGShare/issues/4) Conversion Project.
